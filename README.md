NEWS COLLECTOR

I am building a sentiment analysis for news trading.

This application scrapes a news provider website and returns and saves the scraped results in the database.

The ultimate goal is to use a LLM model to do sentiment analysis on the scraped data.

Have a visualization of the sentiment.

Automate placing orders in the financial Market based on the sentiment.
